### Shir here. 👋

My passion is making developers' lives better through great products.

I'm a senior product manager, with a background as a programmer and productivity consultant. I've built my career around creating delightful technical experiences that make complex tech easy to use. I've worked on DevEx and API products across companies like Microsoft, Deepgram, and now DeepL.

Please have a look around, or [get in touch](https://shirgoldberg.com/contact/). I love meeting people who are similarly passionate!
