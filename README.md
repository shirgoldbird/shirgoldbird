### Shir here. ðŸ‘‹

My passion is making people's lives better with the power of great products.

I'm currrently a product manager, and was previously a developer and consultant. My career throughline has been focused on creating a delightful product experience over complex, cutting-edge tech. I'm especially passionate about building DevEx and API products, and have worked on those at companies like Microsoft, Deepgram, and DeepL.

Please have a look around, or [get in touch](https://shirgoldberg.com/contact/). I love meeting people!
