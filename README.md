My passion is making people's lives better with the power of great products.

I'm currrently a product manager; in past lives, I've worked as a developer and consultant. My career throughline has always been creating usable, delightful technical products. I'm especially passionate about developer tooling and how to get work done better.

Please have a look around, or get in touch. I love meeting people!
